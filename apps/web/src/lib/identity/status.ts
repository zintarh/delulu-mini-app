// A wallet on rung 0 (authCount = 0) is only whitelisted for THREE DAYS. It
// must re-authenticate inside that window — which bumps authCount to 1 — and
// only then does it get the full 180 days.
//
// And it CYCLES. authenticateWithTimestamp() does:
//
//     authCount += 1;
//     if (authCount >= reverifyDaysOptions.length) authCount = 0;
//
// so after the 180 days elapse and the user re-authenticates, authCount wraps
// back to 0 and they land on the 3-day rung AGAIN. The short window is
// therefore a recurring state, not a one-time initiation — never write copy
// that calls it "your first verification".

// lapsed" is the whole point of this module — the two need completely
// different copy, and our own eligibility checks (referral, onboarding gift)
// need to know someone proved they're real at some point, not just whether
